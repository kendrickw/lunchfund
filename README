Lab Lunch Group Mutual Fund Mobile Application
==============================================

This a mobile app optimized for iOS and Android OS. Other mobile devices may work but are untested. This application helps to calculate lunch fund contribution, and also record attendance and lunch fund amount in a spreadsheet hosted on google drive.

Getting Started
---------------
The [zipball of latest release][zipball] contains *index.html* and all the javascripts require to load it. Simply download it and extract the content in the webserver. Once extracted, load the *index.html* page to start the application.

Features
--------

* Pulls list of attendees from google spreadsheet
* Pulls share information from google spreadsheet
* Calculate lunch fund automatically using number of attendees and bill amount
* Keep tracks of submitter in the google spreadsheet

Why not native app?
-------------------

Everything we want to accomplish so far can be done via a web app.  Some of the more advance features (i.e. face recognition) may require us to implement native code.  But until that is implemented, this will remain a web app.

Possible Future Work
--------------------

* Moving backend piece from google spreadsheet to mySQL on webserver
* Build native app (maybe needed for performance anyways)
